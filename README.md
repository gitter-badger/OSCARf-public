Python OSINT Platform

**OSCARf was coded/designed in Linux and Mac. Don't complain if you are running Windows and you cannot get it working**
Windows support is something that I am going to address at a later date.

**Install scripts are now in beta:** https://github.com/V12-Operations/Install-OSCARf

OSCAR-F is designed to aid in the process of information gathering. It was formed with the idea of not having to open
so many tabs in a browser.

There are a few bugs in OSCAR-F, however, we are slowly working on crushing them and working on features.

## Installing

**All setup files are located within the setup directory!**

OSCAR uses a few libraries. These include:

- Twitter
- tweepy
- feedparser
- shodan
- readline
- pillow
- BeautifulSoup4
- Mechanize
- Requests

These can be installed via pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you receive setup errors similar to:
  `compilation terminated.`

  `error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1`
  
Please install the python-dev package: example: `apt-get install python-dev` 

**Please note that you will need to setup ONE twitter app for you/your business.**

~**You will probably need to use sudo to run the setup script. This is becasue it creates files and directories.**~

The the readline feature is completely optional.

Please be sure to run the `DEPENDENCY_CHECK` script first! Additionally, as noted above,  dependencies can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After running the dependency check, run the setup.py script. This will allow you to setup all necessary auth files/data.
**PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SETUP SCRIPT WILL NOT INSTALL MISSING LIBRARIES! Please use pip.**

## To setup Twitter Application

Navigate to: https://apps.twitter.com/ and setup a new application. Please note the name and keys associated with it. 
You sould only need to have a read only application!

## Shodan API KEY

Once you have a ShodanHQ account or login, go to: http://www.shodanhq.com/api_doc and copy the API key. Please note that if you want to use ALL of the shodan functionality of OSCAR, you will need to purchase an "Unlocked API"
